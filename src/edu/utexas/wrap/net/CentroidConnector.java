/**A link through which trip demand begins and enters from a TravelSurveyZone
 * 
 * For all trips across a network, there must be a defined entry and exit point
 * to/from the network. These are TravelSurveyZones, the origin and destination
 * of every trip. To link these TravelSurveyZones to the network, dummy Nodes are
 * created, called centroids, which are not true junction points in roadway nets,
 * but rather can be thought of as the collection of driveways and parking lots
 * in a zone.
 * 
 * These links are generally not congestible, with an exceptionally high capacity
 * usually defined, and a fixed travel time being returned regardless of the amount
 * of flow on the Centroid. To ensure these connectors are not used as through-ways
 * in trips, care must be taken that all trips assigned to this link either start
 * or end at one of the termini of the link.
